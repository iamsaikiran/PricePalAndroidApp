## Problem Statement
People nowadays only spend their money on necessities. As a result, they can only buy anything that is reasonably priced. However, they will need to devote a significant amount of time to visiting all of the stores in order to get product information and conduct a comparison in order to determine which item in which store is more valuable to them. Even if they acquire all of the item details, they will still need to spend a significant amount of time analyzing the items in the stores. Spending their time attempting to figure out all of the product details in multiple stores is a major issue.


## Introduction
The main goal of our application is to build an app for the users which should be very interactive and itâ€™s ease of use, to help a consumer in finding Stores that provide a specific Product in his area. It should also provide a Compare Products feature to compare the prices of a product among different stores.


## Activities
#### Login Page
Every consumer should register here to create an account before he/she begin using the application.

#### Stores
It is used to find what are all the stores available nearby.

#### Products 
To find a specific product, use the search product in Products section.

#### Scan Barcode 
Used to scan the barcode of a particular product.

#### Price Comparison 
To compare the prices of a product among different stores.


## Application Usage Guidelines
Every consumer has to create an account first before using the application features. Then Login with credentials.

#### Scan Barcode:
- A section for scanning a specific barcode can be found in the Scan Barcode section.
- By selecting it, we can scan a product's bar code and obtain product information.
- Additionally there's also a section where you may manually type in the barcode.

#### Price Comparison:
